\section{Exponential Functions} \label{exponential-intro}

In this section, we'll investigate a new type of function that has a constant {\it percent} rate of change, whether it's a constant percent of increase or a constant percent of decrease.  \\[0.5em]

\subsection*{Preparation Exercises} \label{prep-exponential-intro}

\begin{myPrep}
Suppose you have a water filter that can remove 60\% of the contaminants in the water each time the water passes through the filter.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If 60\% of the contaminants are removed with each pass, what percent still remains after a single pass?
		\vfill
		\item If you start with 156.25 mcg of contaminants in some water, how much will be left after you pass the water through the filter once?
		\vfill
		\item How much will be left after a second pass through the filter?
		\vfill
		\item How much will be left after a third pass through the filter?
		\vfill
		\item Will the filter ever remove all of the contaminants from the water?  Why or why not?
		\vfill
	\end{enumerate}
\end{myPrep}
