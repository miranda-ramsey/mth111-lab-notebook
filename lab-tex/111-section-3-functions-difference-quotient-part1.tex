\section{Average Rates of Change and The Difference Quotient} \label{functions-difference-quotient}

In this section, we'll learn how to calculate the average rate of change of a function's output between two specific inputs, as well as evaluate the difference quotient, which is a general form of the average rate of change for a function.\\[0.5em]

\subsection*{Preparation Exercises} \label{prep-difference-quotient}

\begin{myPrep}
Suppose you're driving south on I-5 in Oregon and you pass mile marker 294 in Portland at 1:35 PM.  Later, you pass mile marker 194 in Eugene at 3:05 PM. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What was your average speed (in miles per hour) of the trip from Portland to Eugene?
		\vfill
		\item What was your speed at any particular moment, say as you drove past mile marker 256 in Salem?
		\vfill
	\end{enumerate}
\end{myPrep}

\begin{myPrep}
Let $f(x) = x^2 - 2x$.  Evaluate and simplify the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\begin{multicols}{2}
		\item $f(4)$
		\item $f(-6)$
		\end{multicols}
		\vfill
		\begin{multicols}{2}
		\item $f(a)$
		\item $f(a+h)$
		\end{multicols}
		\vfill
	\end{enumerate}
\end{myPrep}
