\section{Functions and Function Notation} \label{functions-and-notation}

In this section, we'll develop our understanding of functions and function notation, whether the function is presented as a set of ordered pairs, a table of values, a graph, or an equation.  We'll also learn how to evaluate a function given an input value and to solve for an input given a function's output value.\\[0.5em]

\subsection*{Preparation Exercises} \label{prep-functions-and-notation}


\begin{myPrep}
Many of us have at least one restaurant we would love to go to for a meal.  \\
Go online and find a menu for a restaurant you'd choose to eat at.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is the name of the restaurant and what type of food do they serve?
		\vfill
		\item What is a dish you would like to get and how much does it cost?
		\vfill
		\item Are there any other dishes on the menu that costs the same as your dish? \\
		If so, what are they?
		\vfill
		\item If I ask you the price of any specific dish from the menu, do you know how much it costs? 
		\vfill
		\item If you know how much I paid for a dish, do you know exactly what I ordered based just on the price?  Explain your answer.
