    <title>Graphs of Polynomial Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we'll focus on the short-term behaviors of polynomial 
            functions and the location and behavior of the <m>x</m>-intercepts can 
            be identified from their factored algebraic form.  We'll then use this 
            knowledge to both graph polynomial functions, as well as construct 
            polynomial functions based on a graph.

            <title>Multiplicity</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    The <term>multiplicity</term> of a factor is the number of times that factor occurs in the factored version of the polynomial.  We will also refer to the <term>multiplicity of the zero</term> for the zero associated with this factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The sum of the multiplicities of the real roots for a polynomial function is less than or equal to the degree of the polynomial.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <example>
                <p>
                    For <m>f(x) = 3(x-5)(x+4)^2</m>, the multiplicity of <m>5</m> is one and the multiplicity of <m>-4</m> is two.

            <title>Even Multiplicity</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    When a root or zero has even multiplicity, then the graphical behavior at the associated <m>x</m>-intercept is that the graph will touch, but not cross, the <m>x</m>-axis at that <m>x</m>-intercept.
                </p>

            <title>Odd Multiplicity</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    When a root or zero has odd multiplicity, then the graphical behavior at the associated <m>x</m>-intercept is that the graph will cross over the <m>x</m>-axis at that <m>x</m>-intercept.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the multiplicity of a root is one, the graph will cross through the <m>x</m>-intercept in a somewhat linear manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the multiplicity of a root is a larger odd number, the graph will cross through the <m>x</m>-intercept by flattening out as it crosses.
