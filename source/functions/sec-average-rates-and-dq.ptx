            <title>Rate of Change</title>
            <statement>
				<p>
						A <term>rate of change</term> describes how the output values change in relation to a change in the input values. The unit for the rate of change is "output unit(s) per input unit."
						</p>
            </statement>
        </definition>

        <definition>
            <title>Average Rate of Change</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
					The <term>average rate of change</term> for a function <m>f</m> between two input values <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> is the difference in their output values divided by the difference in the two input values. The average rate of change is calculated using the formula
					<me>\text{average rate of change } = \dfrac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}, x_1 \neq x_2</me>
						The average rate of change is the slope of the line between the two points <m>(x_1, f(x_1))</m> and <m>(x_2, f(x_2))</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
			<example>
				<p>The function <m>E(x)</m> gives the cost of a dozen eggs (in dollars) <m>x</m> years after 2010. If we know <m>E(19) = 1.362</m> and <m>E(23) = 2.666</m>, we can find the average rate of change as
				<md>
					<mrow>\dfrac{E(23)-E(19)}{23 \text{ years } - 19 \text{ years}} \amp = \dfrac{\$2.666 - \$1.362}{4 \text{ years}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp = \dfrac{\$1.304}{4 \text{ years}}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp \approx \$0.33/\text{year}</mrow>
			</md>
				This shows that between 2019 and 2023, the cost of a dozen eggs increased on average by about $0.33/year.
			</p>
			</example>
        </definition>
			
        <definition>
            <title>Difference Quotient</title>
            <statement>
				<p>
					The <term>difference quotient</term> for a function <m>f</m> is given by the formula
					<me>\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}, h \neq 0</me>
						The difference quotient is the average rate of change between the two points <m>(x, f(x))</m> and <m>(x+h, f(x+h))</m>. 
                </p>
            </statement>
			<example>
				Given the function <m>f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x</m>, the difference quotient would be evaluated as
				<md>
					<mrow>\dfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \amp = \dfrac{(3(x+h)^2 - 4(x+h)) - (3x^2 - 4x)}{h}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp = \dfrac{3x^2 + 6xh + 3h^2 - 4x - 4h - 3x^2 + 4x}{h}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp = \dfrac{6xh + 3h^2 - 4h}{h}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp = \dfrac{h(6x + 3h - 4)}{h}</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp = 6x + 3h - 4, h \neq 0</mrow>
				</md>
