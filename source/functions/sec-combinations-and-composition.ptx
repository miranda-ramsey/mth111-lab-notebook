    <title>Algebraic Combinations of Functions and Function Composition</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
			In this section, we'll learn about several ways we can combine funcitons algebraically, as well as use
			the output from one function as the input for another. As we've done before, we'll investigate these ideas 
			with functions presented as graphs, as tables, and as formulas.

						Two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> can be combined using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division as follows:
