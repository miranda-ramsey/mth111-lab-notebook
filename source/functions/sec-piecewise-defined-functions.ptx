    <title>Piecewise Defined Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
			In this section, we'll explore piecewise-defined functions, which 
			are functions constructed from pieces of several other functions. 
			We'll find the domain and range of these types of functions, as 
			well as graph, evaluate, and solve them. And given the graph of a 
			piecewise-defined function, we'll construct the formula for the 
			graph's function.
