    <title>Exponential and Logarithmic Models</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we'll investigate a few ways that exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model the world around us, as well as how logarithms help us to quantify sound levels, acidity, and earthquakes.

                    A research student is working with a culture of bacteria that doubles in size every 13 minutes.  The initial population count was 1350 bacteria.  Find an exponential function that expresses the bacteria population, <m>P</m>, as a function of <m>t</m>, the number of <em>hours</em> after the experiment began.
