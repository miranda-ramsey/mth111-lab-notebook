  "body": " Functions and Function Notation   In this section, we’ll develop our understanding of functions and function notation, whether the function is presented as a set of ordered pairs, a table of values, a graph, or an equation. We’ll also learn how to evaluate a function given an input value and to solve for an input given a function’s output value.    Textbook Reference  This relates to content in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 of Algebra and Trigonometry 2e .    Preparation Exercises   Preparation 1   Many of us have at least one restaurant we would love to go to for a meal. Go online and find a menu for a restaurant you'd choose to eat at.     What is the name of the restaurant and what type of food do they serve?      What is a dish you would like to get and how much does it cost?      Are there any other dishes on the menu that cost the same as your dish? If so, what are they?      If I ask you the price of any specific dish from the menu, do you know how much it costs?      If you know how much I paid for a dish, do you know exactly what I ordered based just on the price? Explain your answer.       Practice Exercises   Practice 1    Determine if each of the following relations show as a function of .  Explain your reasoning by referncing the definition of a function. If a relation is not a function provide a specific example why the definition was not satisfied.  Assume all ordered pairs are of the form .                                                    Practice 2    Let be defined as the set of ordered pairs:     Find .    Solve .           Find .    Solve .      Let     Find .    Solve .       Definitions   Relation   A relation is a set of ordered pairs.   The variable of is called the independent variable or input variable .  Each individual -value is refered to as a input or input value .    The variable of is called the dependent variable or output variable .  Each individual -value is refered to as a output or output value .     Relation  The set is a relation.     Function   A function is a relation where each possible input value is paired with exactly one output value. We say, \"The output is a function of the input,\" and often write this algebraically as .    Function  The set is a function.    Not a function  The set is a relation, but not a function.     Domain and Range    The Domain of a relation or function is the set of all possible input values.  The Range of a relation or function is the set of all possible output values.     Domain and Range  Given the function the domain of the function is and the range of the function is .     Vertical Line Test   If a vertical line can be drawn that intersects the graph more than once, the graph is not the graph of a function with as the independent variable and as the dependent variable.    Does not pass       Passes         Exit Exercises   Exit 1   What is the definition of a function?    What are two examples of functions that you use in your daily life outside of school? Explain how these are functions, referencing the definition of a function.    What do you look for in the graph of a relation to determine if the graph is the graph of a function or not? Fully explain your answer.     Exit 2   If , evaluate .     Exit 3   If , solve .

Textbook Reference  This relates to content in Section 3.4 of Algebra and Trigonometry 2e .    Preparation Exercises   Preparation 1   Suppose it costs a bakery $3,000 for rent and utilities each month and each loaf of bread costs $2.15 to produce.

Find a function that calculates the total revenue (in dollars) each month from selling loaves of bread.      Find a function that calculates the profit (in dollars) from producing and selling loaves of bread each month. (Note: The profit is the difference between the revenue and costs.)
