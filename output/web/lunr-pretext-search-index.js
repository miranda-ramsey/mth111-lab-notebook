  "body": "Portland Community College Math Department           Preface   This lab manual was designed with the intent of being used in the following manner. In each section:   Students will complete the Preparation Exercises before receiving instruction on the content. Some instructors will have students do this before coming to class, while others might do it as a warmup in class.    There will be some instructor-led presentation of the content. This may be a formal class lecture, a discovery activity, a video lecture, or something else.    Students will then engage in Practice Exercises in a group setting to reinforce their initial understanding of the foundational concepts.    An instructor will then assign one or more group activities. Because many of these activities are webbased and instructors can choose to use different activities, we have not included any of the possible activities in this document.    The Definitions are meant to provide a single location for all definitions and some key concepts. Students can use this as a resource after having covered the topics in class.    Students will complete some or all of the Exit Exercises, as decided by their instructor, to summarize their understanding of key concepts.    In general, not every section of this lab manual will take the same amount of class time. Some sections might be half-day topics, while others could be two-day topics.    Each instructor will identify for their class which exercises will be submitted as part of the course grade.

  "body": " Functions and Function Notation   In this section, we’ll develop our understanding of functions and function notation, whether the function is presented as a set of ordered pairs, a table of values, a graph, or an equation. We’ll also learn how to evaluate a function given an input value and to solve for an input given a function’s output value.    Textbook Reference  This relates to content in 3.1 and 3.2 of Algebra and Trigonometry 2e .    Preparation Exercises   Preparation 1   Many of us have at least one restaurant we would love to go to for a meal. Go online and find a menu for a restaurant you'd choose to eat at.     What is the name of the restaurant and what type of food do they serve?      What is a dish you would like to get and how much does it cost?      Are there any other dishes on the menu that cost the same as your dish? If so, what are they?      If I ask you the price of any specific dish from the menu, do you know how much it costs?      If you know how much I paid for a dish, do you know exactly what I ordered based just on the price? Explain your answer.       Practice Exercises   Practice 1   Determine if each of the following relations show as a function of . Explain your reasoning by referncing the definition of a function. If a relation is not a function provide a specific example why the definition was not satisfied. Assume all ordered pairs are of the form .                                                   Practice 2    Let be defined as the set of ordered pairs:   Find .  Solve .             Find .  Solve .        Let .   Find .    Solve .          Definitions   Relation   A relation is a set of ordered pairs.   The variable of is called the independent variable or input variable .  Each individual -value is refered to as a input or input value .    The variable of is called the dependent variable or output variable .  Each individual -value is refered to as a output or output value .     Relation  The set is a relation.     Function   A function is a relation where each possible input value is paired with exactly one output value. We say, \"The output is a function of the input,\" and often write this algebraically as .    Function  The set is a function.    Not a function  The set is a relation, but not a function.     Domain and Range    The Domain of a relation or function is the set of all possible input values.  The Range of a relation or function is the set of all possible output values.     Domain and Range  Given the function the domain of the function is and the range of the function is .     Vertical Line Test   If a vertical line can be drawn that intersects the graph more than once, the graph is not the graph of a function with as the independent variable and as the dependent variable.    Does not pass   Does Not Pass        Passes   Passes          Exit Exercises   Exit 1   What is the definition of a function?    What are two examples of functions that you use in your daily life outside of school? Explain how these are functions, referencing the definition of a function.    What do you look for in the graph of a relation to determine if the graph is the graph of a function or not? Fully explain your answer.     Exit 2  If , evaluate .    Exit 3  If , solve .

Definitions   Simple Interest   The formula to calculate simple interest is where  is the amount of interest earned,  is the principal or intiial amount of money,  is the annual interest rate, and  is the number of years the interest is earned.       Compound Interest   The formula to calculate compound interest is where  is total amount of money owed or earned,  is the principal,  is the nominal annual interest rate,  is the number of times the interst is compounded per year, and  is the number of years the interest is earned.   Note: This formula is used where there is a finite number of compounding per year.

Continuously Compounded Interest   The formula to calculate continuously compounded interest is where  is total amount of money owed or earned,  is the principal,  is the nominal annual interest rate, and  is the number of years the interest is earned.   Note: This formula is used when the compounding happens continuously.      Effective Interest Rate   The effective interest rate , is the equivalent interest rate that, if compounded annually, would yield the same result after 1 year as compounding the stated nominal rate times per year or compounding the nominal rate continuously.  When compounding times per year, , where is the nominal annual interest rate.  When compounding continuously, , where is the nominal annual interest rate.      Exit Exercises   Exit 1   In the year 2001, Alyssa opened a retirement account that earns a nominal interest rate 7.25% per year. Her initial deposit was $13,500. How much will the account be worth in 2025 if interest compounds monthly? How much more would she make if interest compounded continuously?     Exit 2   Kyoko received a $10,000 scholarship that she gets to invest for college. Her bank has several investment accounts to choose from, all compounding daily. Her goal is to have $15,000 by the time she finishes high school in 6 years. To the nearest hundredth of a percent, what should her minimum nominal interest rate be in order to reach her goal?     Exit 3   A small business is planning on building a new facility in 9 years. They can invest money at 7% annual interest, compounded daily, right now. If they need $600,000 to build the new facility in 9 years, what is the minimum they need to invest to ensure they have $600,000 in 9 years?

  "body": " Graphs of Rational Functions   In this section, we'll continue working with rational functions. We'll examine the long-term or end behavior and see what happens when there is a common root of the numerator and denominator. We'll then use everything we've learned about rational functions to graph them, as well as construct rational functions based on a given graph.    Textbook Reference  This relates to content in 5.6 of Algebra and Trigonometry 2e .    Preparation Exercises   Preparation 1   Suppose a bakery has daily fixed costs of $150. To produce a single loaf of bread costs an additional $2.75 for labor and materials.     Find a function that calculates the daily cost per loaf, in dollars, to produce loaves of bread.    To find the cost per loaf, you need to divide the total costs by the number of loaves of bread.      If the bakery produce 5 loaves of bread, what is the cost per loaf?      If the bakery produce 50 loaves of bread, what is the cost per loaf?      If the bakery produce 500 loaves of bread, what is the cost per loaf?      What is happening to the per loaf cost as the number of loaves made increases?      Is there a limit to the how low the cost per loaf can go?       Practice Exercises   Practice 1   The function does not have a horizontal asymptote. How could you change the formula for this function so that it does have a horizontal asymptote?     Practice 2   Let . Answer the following without using a calculator.     What is the domain of ?      What is the -intercept of graph of ?      What are the -intercepts of the graph of ?      What are the vertical asymptotes of the graph of ?      Does the graph of have any holes? Why or why not?      If the graph of has any holes,find the coordinates of the hole(s).      Does the graph of have a horizontal asymptote? Why or why not?      If the graph of has a horizontal asymptote, state its equation.      Practice 3   Graph in . Clearly identify all vertical asymptotes, -intercepts, the -intercept, any holes, and any horizontal asymptote.           Practice 4   Find a possible formula for the rational function graphed in . Take into account the vertical asymptote(s), the -intercept(s), the -intercept, and whether or not there is a horizontal asymptote.            Definitions   Holes or Removable Discontinuities   A hole or removable discontinuity for a rational function occurs at an -value that is a root of both the numerator and denominator and whose multiplicity in the numerator is greater than or equal to its multiplicity in the denominator. Note: If the multiplicity of the root is greater in the denominator, then the root will create a vertical asymptote.     There is a removable discontinuity at for and , but is a vertical asymptote for .     Horizontal Asymptotes of Rational Functions   Whether a rational function has is a horizontal asymptote can be determined by comparing the degrees of the numerator and denominator.  If the degree of the denominator is greater than that of the numerator, the function will have a horizontal asymptote of .  If the degree of the denominator is equal to that of the numerator, the function will have a horizontal asymptote. The equation of the horizontal asymptote will be based on the ratio of the leading coefficients.  If the degree of the denominator is lessre than that of the numerator, the function will not have a horizontal asymptote.       has a horizontal asymptote of .     has a horizontal asymptote of .     has no horizontal asymptote.
