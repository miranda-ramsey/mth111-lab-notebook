  "body": " Functions and Function Notation   In this section, we’ll develop our understanding of functions and function notation, whether the function is presented as a set of ordered pairs, a table of values, a graph, or an equation. We’ll also learn how to evaluate a function given an input value and to solve for an input given a function’s output value.    Textbook Reference  This relates to content in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 of Algebra and Trigonometry 2e .    Preparation 1   Many of us have at least one restaurant we would love to go to for a meal. Go online and find a menu for a restaurant you'd choose to eat at.     What is the name of the restaurant and what type of food do they serve?      What is a dish you would like to get and how much does it cost?      Are there any other dishes on the menu that cost the same as your dish? If so, what are they?      If I ask you the price of any specific dish from the menu, do you know how much it costs?      If you know how much I paid for a dish, do you know exactly what I ordered based just on the price? Explain your answer.      Practice 1    Determine if each of the following relations show as a function of .  Explain your reasoning by referncing the definition of a function. If a relation is not a function provide a specific example why the definition was not satisfied.  Assume all ordered pairs are of the form .      {  }                                         INSERT GRAPH HERE     Practice 2   a   Let be defined as the set of ordered pairs:     Find .
